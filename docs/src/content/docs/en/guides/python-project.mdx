The Python project generator can be used to create a modern [Python](https://www.python.org/) library or application configured with best practices, managed with [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a single lockfile and virtual environment in an [UV workspace](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/), [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for running tests, and [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for static analysis.

## Usage

### Generate a Python Project

You can generate a new Python project in two ways:

<RunGenerator generator="py#project" />

### Options

<GeneratorParameters generator="py#project" />

## Generator Output

The generator will create the following project structure in the `<directory>/<name>` directory:

<FileTree>

  - \<module-name>
    - \_\_init\_\_.py Module initialisation
    - hello.py Example Python source file
  - tests
    - \_\_init\_\_.py Module initialisation
    - conftest.py Test configuration
    - test_hello.py Example tests
  - project.json Project configuration and build targets
  - pyproject.toml Packaging configuration file used by UV
  - .python-version Contains the project's Python version

</FileTree>

You may also notice the following files created/updated in the root of your workspace:

<FileTree>

  - pyproject.toml Workspace level packaging configuration for UV
  - .python-version Contains the workspace Python version
  - uv.lock Lockfile for Python dependencies

</FileTree>

## Writing Python Source Code

Add your Python source code in the `<module-name>` directory.

### Importing your Library Code in Other Projects

Since [UV workspaces](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/) are set up for you, you can reference your Python project from any other Python project in your workspace:

```python title="packages/my_other_project/my_other_project/main.py"
from "my_library.hello" import say_hello
```

Above, `my_library` is the module name, `hello` corresponds to the Python source file `hello.py`, and `say_hello` is a method defined in `hello.py`

### Dependencies

To add dependencies to your project, you can run the `add` target in your Python project, for example:

<NxCommands commands={['run my_scope.my_library:add some-pip-package']} />

This will add the dependency to your project's `pyproject.toml` file, and update the root `uv.lock`.

#### Runtime Code

When you use your Python project as runtime code (for example as the handler for an AWS lambda function), you will need to create a bundle of the source code and all its dependencies. You can achieve this by adding a target such as the following to your `project.json` file:

```json title="project.json"
{
  ...
  "targets": {
    ...
    "bundle": {
      "cache": true,
      "executor": "nx:run-commands",
      "outputs": ["{workspaceRoot}/dist/packages/my_library/bundle"],
      "options": {
        "commands": [
          "uv export --frozen --no-dev --no-editable --project packages/my_library -o dist/packages/my_library/bundle/requirements.txt",
          "uv pip install -n --no-installer-metadata --no-compile-bytecode --python-platform x86_64-manylinux2014 --python `uv python pin` --target dist/packages/my_library/bundle -r dist/packages/my_library/bundle/requirements.txt"
        ],
        "parallel": false
      },
      "dependsOn": ["compile"]
    },
  },
}
```

### Building

Your Python project is configured with a `build` target (defined in `project.json`), which you can run via:

<NxCommands commands={['run <project-name>:build']} />

Where `<project-name>` is the fully qualified name of your project.

The `build` target will compile, lint and test your project.

Build output can be found in the root `dist` folder in your workspace, inside a directory for your package and target, for example `dist/packages/<my-library>/build`

## Testing

[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is configured for testing your project.

### Writing Tests

Tests should be written in the `test` directory within your project, in python files prefixed with `test_`, for example:

<FileTree>
  - my_library
    - hello.py
  - test
    - test_hello.py Tests for hello.py
</FileTree>

Tests are methods which begin with `test_` and make assertions to verify expectations, for example:

```python title="test/test_hello.py"
from my_library.hello import say_hello

def test_say_hello():
  assert say_hello("Darth Vader") == "Hello, Darth Vader!"
```

For more details about how to write tests, please refer to the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/assert.html#).

### Running Tests

Tests will run as part of the `build` target for your project, but you can also run them separately by running the `test` target:

<NxCommands commands={['run <project-name>:test']} />

You can run an individual test or suite of tests using the `-k` flag, specifying either the name of the test file or method:

<NxCommands commands={["run <project-name>:test -k 'test_say_hello'"]} />

## Linting

Python projects use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting.

### Running the Linter

To invoke the linter to check your project, you can run the `lint` target.

<NxCommands commands={["run <project-name>:lint"]} />

### Fixing Lint Issues

The majority of linting or formatting issues can be fixed automatically. You can tell Ruff to fix lint issues by running with the `--configuration=fix` argument.

<NxCommands commands={["run <project-name>:lint --configuration=fix"]} />

Similarly if you would like to fix all lint issues in all packages in your workspace, you can run:

<NxCommands commands={["run-many --target lint --all --configuration=fix"]} />

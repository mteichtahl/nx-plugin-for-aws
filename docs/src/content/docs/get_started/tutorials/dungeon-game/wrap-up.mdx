## Wrap up

Congratulations! You’ve created a dungeon adventure game that utilizes many of the available generators found within the `@aws/nx-plugin`.  🎉🎉🎉

## What's next?

We recommend you try your hand at extending the codebase with the following capabilities on your own:

1. Add the [license generator](/nx-plugin-for-aws/guides/license) to your project which will automatically manage LICENSE files and source code headers in your workspace.
2. [Create your own generator](/nx-plugin-for-aws/get_started/tutorials/create-generator) to simplify the addition on new tRPC apis.
3. Add a new `resetToAction` api (using your above generator) in GameAPI which allows you to go back in time and delete all actions from a given point. Then update the UI to add a button on a conversation bubble to reset to this point (and call the newly created API).
4. Explore the various guides available

### Destroying resources

To destroy the AWS resources that were created, run the following command:

<NxCommands commands={['run @dungeon-adventure/infra:destroy --all']} />

This will prompt you for a list of stacks to delete which should comprise of the `waf` and `infra-sandbox`. Enter `Y` and then Cloudformation will destroy your stacks.

Aaaand we're live! 🚀

The Nx Plugin for AWS is an [Nx](https://nx.dev/) plugin that provides a toolkit for simplifying the process of building and deploying full-stack applications on AWS. It provides developers with pre-configured templates for both application and IaC code, significantly reducing the time spent on setup and configuration. The plugin handles the complexity of AWS service integration while maintaining flexibility for customization.

Users simplify pick and choose which components they want from the list of available generators, provide any configuration options and have the `@aws/nx-plugin` generate the required starter code. Several generators exist within this toolkit which can create APIs, websites, infrastructure and even do more sophistacted things like integrated a frontend to a backend (including updating existing files via AST transforms!) with type-safe clients.
